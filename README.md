The course is broken up into five sections, Data Modeling, Cloud Data Warehouses, Data Lake with Spark, Data Pipelines with Airflow, and a capstone project. 
The structure for each section consists of introducing concepts through lectures, demos and exercises, and concludes with 1-2 project(s). 
In the projects it is necessary to design an ETL process using song data for an imaginary company called *Sparkify*.
